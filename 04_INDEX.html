    ### **1. What are Forms in HTML?**
Forms are HTML elements that allow users to input and submit data to a server for processing. They are essential for creating interactive web applications. 

### **Why Use Forms?**
- To collect user information (e.g., name, email, password).
- To allow user interaction (e.g., surveys, feedback, registrations).
- To submit data to servers for storage, computation, or further processing.

#### **Form Use Cases**
- Login and Signup Forms
- Feedback and Survey Forms
- Payment and Checkout Forms
- Search Bars
- File Uploads

<form action="">


    <!-- <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" id = "username" name = "username"> -->

    <br>
    <br>
    
    <!-- <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" id = "password" name = "password">
 -->

    <!-- <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" id = "password" name = "password">
     -->
    
    <!-- <input type="week" id = "password" name = "password">
    <input type="range" id = "password" name = "password">
    <input type="password" id = "password" name = "password"> -->

    <!-- <label for="search">search</label>
    <input type="search" id = "search" name = "password">
    <input type="tel" id = "search" name = "password"> -->


    <!-- <form action=""  method="post"></form> -->

    <!-- 2. **`method`**
   - Defines the HTTP method used to send form data to the server.
     - **GET**: Sends data appended to the URL as query parameters. Best for non-sensitive data like search queries.
     - **POST**: Sends data in the request body, suitable for sensitive or large amounts of data like passwords or file uploads. -->

     <!-- 3. **`autocomplete`**
   - Enables or disables the browser's autofill functionality for form fields.
     - **`on`** (default): Browser suggests previously entered values.
     - **`off`**: Disables autofill for the form or specific fields. -->


     <!-- <form action="/submit-data" method="get" autocomplete="off">

        <input type="text" name="username" >
        <button type = "submit">submit</button>
     </form>


     <form action="" method="get" autocomplete>
        <input type="text">
     </form> -->

     <!-- <form action="/submit-data" method="post">

        <input type="text" name="username" >
        <button type = "submit">submit</button>
     </form> -->

     <!-- 1. **`_self` (Default)**
     - Displays the form submission response in the same browser tab or window where the form was submitted.
     - Best suited for workflows where the user should stay in the same browsing context. -->

     <form action="/submit" target="_self">
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="input1">
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>


     <!-- 2 . **`_blank`**
   - Opens the form submission response in a new browser tab or window.
   - Ideal for cases where the submitted form leads to additional information or actions that users may want to explore without losing their current page. -->
 

     <form action="/submit" target="_blank">
        <input type="text" name="search" placeholder="input2">
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>
