## 1. Introduction to HTML

### What is HTML?
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website. It structures the content.
- Think of HTML as a blueprint for web pages. Without it, websites wouldn't exist.
- **HyperText**: Text with links to other pages.
- **Markup Language**: A system for annotating text to define its structure and behavior.

## 2. HTML Elements & Tags
### What Are Tags and Elements?
- Tags are like containers that hold content.
- **Opening Tag**: `<p>`
- **Closing Tag**: `</p>`
- Combined, they form an element: `<p>Paragraph text here</p>`.

### Commonly Used Tags:
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings.
- `<p>` for paragraphs.
- `<a>` for links.
- `<img>` for images (self-closing tag)

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Tells the browser it’s an HTML5 document.
- `<html>`: The root of the document.
- `<head>`: Metadata (title, character encoding, etc.).
- `<body>`: Where visible content goes.

## 4. Paragraph Element

### What is `<p>`?
The `<p>` tag defines paragraphs of text.

### Adding Breaks:
Use `<br>` for line breaks.
```html
<p>This is a paragraph with a <br> line break.</p>
```
## 5. Heading Elements

### Headings Overview:
- HTML headings range from `<h1>` (largest) to `<h6>` (smallest).
- Headings help structure content and improve SEO.

### Example:
```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading Level 1</h2>
<h3>Subheading Level 2</h3>
```


### Semantic Importance:
- `<h1>` is typically used for the page’s title.
- Subheadings organize content into sections.

### Styling Headings:
```html
<h1 style="color: green;">This heading is green!</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Centered Subheading</h2>

## Explanation:
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Supports special characters (e.g., accents, symbols).
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures mobile responsiveness.
```
